# DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure

## Course Labs

Welcome to the hands-on lab exercises for course [DP-100 *Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01). The labs are designed to accompany the course and enable you to practice using the technologies described in the classroom materials.

You should complete the labs in order, following the instructions in each Markdown document carefully.

The labs require a Microsoft Azure subscription. If your instructor has not provided you with one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).

> **Tip**: As you work through the labs, you may experience unexpected issues due to idiosyncratic browser settings, network configurations, and so on. We've documented a few common issues in the [Tips](TIPS.md) document that may help. You can also view [known issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP100/issues) for these labs.

> **Important**: Remember to stop any virtual machines used in these labs when you no longer need them - this will minimize the Azure credit incurred for these services. When you have completed all of the labs, consider deleting the resource group you created if you don't plan to experiment with it any further.
